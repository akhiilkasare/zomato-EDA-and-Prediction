# DSWG New Project Guide

## General Guidelines

Ideally, a DSWG Project has the following:
- Team lead(s)
- Project Manager
- Github Repo
- Slack Channel
- Intent towards answering a set of questions that can be summarized as some sort of deliverable, eg:
    - a workbook
    - a report
    - a presentation
    - a website
    - a blog posting
    
Nice to haves:
- has a community or government partner within a few weeks
- Blog posts describing major project milestones on the website

## Github

- Setup a github repo on sfbrigade's github with the form `github.com/sfbrigade/datasci-{projectname}`
    - If you need help reach out to one of the DSWG Leads 
- Create a `README.md` file using the template in this repo [README-template.md](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg/blob/master/dswg_project_resources/Project-README-template.md)
- Create a Pull Request Template using the template in this repo [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](../PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- The most important features here are "current needs" and "contact" so that new members can learn more


## Slack

- Create a slack channel of the form `#datasci-{projectname}`
- In the "About" section, set the channel's purpose and include a link to the project's Github page
